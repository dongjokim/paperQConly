Abstract
9 "The results were obtained with the multi-particle cumulant method." => "The results were obtained with the new multiparticle method dubbed symmetric cumulants.”
done
10 "The method" => "This method”
done
13 See if you can drop here "model" (since there is "models" immediately afterwards)
done
14 See if you want to split large sentence "The comparisons..." in two or even three smaller ones
done
15 \eta/s is used before being defined
defined
16 flavored => favored
fixed
16 Is anything special about "AMPT initial condition"? If not, perhaps we can spell out immediately the details of most successive Glauber configuration for initial conditions
this is special, it is described in the model description.
o What is clearly missing in the abstract in some executive summary for pT dependence (e.g. is it trivial, non-trivial, same trends for all correlations, etc.)
yes, i try to add it but forgot it.
I prepared as following and try to improve it a bit later.
We have found that $v_3$-$v_2$ and $v_4$-$v_2$ correlations have moderate $p_{\rm T}$ dependence in mid central collisions. This might be an indication of possible viscous corrections for the equilibrium distribution at hadronic freeze-out.

21,28,54 "heavy ion" => "heavy-ion”
done
23 "matter" => "nuclear matter”
done
24 "transverse plane, driven" => "plane transverse to the beam direction, which is driven”
done
24 "pressure" => "anisotropic pressure”
done
24 "with more" => "resulting in a more". Btw, is this really so: Do we have the same number of particles, just particles in the direction of largest gradients are pushed faster?

26 in => at
fixed
28 "strongly interacting matter" => “QGP"
done
30 I feel that the transition to paragraph 2 is a bit too sharp, in a sense that it is not clear why all of a sudden temperature dependence of \eta/s is so important. To motivate it, perhaps we can advocate that otherwise it is very difficult to understand why ideal hydro worked better at RHIC than at LHC. For a help to formulate this, we can ask Pasi Huovinen (I see later that you have discussed this in lines 56-58)
i reshuffled the order, will try to bridge them smoothly
31 "One such general behavior is that" => "For instance, “
done
31 "ratio" => "it" (note that you refer to "temperature dependence", not to "ratio"). If you adopt this suggestion, than please change on the same line "its" into “the"
ratio
33 "an order" => "the correct order”
done
33 "shear viscosity to entropy ratio" => "value found”
done
34 found => demonstrated
done
34 "one can calculate" is too colloquial, see if you want to replace this with "can be calculated", and pull it just before “using"
done
35 supports => support
done
36 see if you want to drop “indeed"
done
36 "to other" => "for other”
fixed
38 "QCD" abbreviation is not defined
done
40 Again, transition to this paragraph is too sharp. Perhaps at the end of previous paragraph you could write that we can probe \eta/s by studying non-trivial collective properties of QGP, like anisotropic flow, and then naturally in the next paragraph you start describing what is anisotropic flow
yes, after i changed the oerder of the phragraph, it looks better, originally it was intended differently ^;;
I will try to bridge them smoothly ...

40 See if immediately after "Anisotropic flow" you want to cite http://inspirehep.net/record/31918/
done
41,44 Please unify the notation for symmetry planes
i think it is ok.
46 derived => calculated
done
46 "flow" => "flow in heavy-ion collisions", and "response" => "response of produced matter”
done
47 deformation => deformations
done
47 I think we need to specify "density" of what, perhaps "energy density”
yes, it should be energy density
50 fluctuation => fluctuations
done
50 "higher" => "higher flow”
done
51 Besides ATLAS, I would cite here also https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1008
done
52 "[19,20]." => "[19,20], while correlations have the potential to discriminate the two respective contributions to anisotropic flow development [cite https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1008]”
done
52 See if you want to drop the sentence "And ...", or at least rephrase it, it doesn't read well in the current form
54 on => in
i am not sure, it should be “on” ?
54 "shear viscosity" alone or the ratio?
changed to eta/s
54 "has been realized since it" => "collisions can be attributed mostly to the fact that it”
done
55 "of the" => "for the”
i think it is correct.
55-56 Is this statement true for anisotropic flow, or only for elliptic flow? (The same comment for sentence in 58-59)
This is a good question, only it was demonstrated for v2 in the papers cited, but i think it should be similar as others aw well.
Quantitively it will be different but the general trend should be. 
61 "The higher harmonics" => "While elliptic and triangular flow can be described well solely in terms of linear response, the higher harmonics". Btw, I fear that before starting to speak about linear and nonlinear response, most likely we will need to introduce eccentricities, etc 
Let’s me see if i can add few sentences there.
62 "lower-order" => "lower order”
done
62 "harmonic order" => "order of harmonic”
done
65 If it's not used afterwards in the text, see if you want to drop "\delta f". If you adopt this suggestion, then just pre-pend "which is”
to "a correction”
done
69 "Recently we measured" => "Recently, the ALICE Collaboration measured" (and that somewhere in this sentence add citation)

73 expending => expanding

73 "and simultaneous" => "and therefore simultaneous”
